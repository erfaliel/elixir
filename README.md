Before you start working through the tutorial, you will need:

## a. Elixir installed on your computer. See: learn-elixir#installation

When you run the command:

```elixir -v```
You should expect to see output similar to the following:

Elixir 1.12.3 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 24)
This informs us we are using Elixir version 1.12.3 which is the latest version at the time of writing.


## b. Phoenix installed on your computer. see: hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html

If you run the following command in your terminal:

```mix phx.new -v```
You should see something similar to the following:

Phoenix installer v1.6.0
ownload the Dependencies

# Install
Install the dependencies by running the command:

mix setup
It will take a few seconds to download the dependencies depending on the speed of your internet connection; be patient.
